# Instagram-user-analytics
This project is divided into two parts – Marketing and Investor Metrics; 
In the case of this task, a database was created with the information of the people on Instagram and their activities that were being recorded, which was later used for analysis.
In the case of Marketing, the task was to identify the following:
•	The Most Loyal Users, 
•	Identify the inactive users and ask them to start posting, 
•	Identify the people whose pictures received the most likes, 
•	Identify the best Hashtags that can be used to reach more people on Instagram  
•	Identify the best day to launch Ads.
In Investor metrics, the focus was :
•	To find how many times the average user posts on Instagram and to provide the total number of photos / total number of users on Instagram.  
•	The task ends by finding Bots or Fake accounts, and as in this case, the work was to identify the accounts that have liked every single picture on the site.
